# MCP Servers

:thinking: What is MCP Server? To put it in short from what I have understood so far, it's a way to expose the REST API interface to the AI agents to enable human-like interaction. To learn about it in detail please check out the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).


## :speaker: Kind Notice
This project started purely out of curiosity and a hunger for knowledge. With AI/ML rapidly evolving into one of the most exciting fields in technology, I wanted a hands-on way to learn, experiment, and upskill and this felt like the perfect excuse to roll up my sleeves and learn by building.

The idea behind this repo is simple: build something that helps me (and maybe others) understand how MCP servers work, without being weighed down by the pressure of making it production-grade.

Because this project is more of a learning journey, it doesn’t aim to cover every feature exposed by the official application APIs, hence may not be perfect and production-ready. Instead, it focuses on exploring the core concepts, and experimenting with different ideas.

If you’re here to learn, tinker, or just explore alongside me — welcome aboard :rocket:
