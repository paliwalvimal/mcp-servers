# MCP Servers

MCP servers for various apps.


## Context
This project started purely out of curiosity and a hunger for knowledge. With AI/ML rapidly evolving into one of the most exciting fields in technology, I wanted a hands-on way to learn, experiment, and upskill and this felt like the perfect excuse to roll up my sleeves and learn by building.

The idea behind this repo is simple: build something that helps me (and maybe others) understand how MCP servers work, without being weighed down by the pressure of making it production-grade.

Because this project is more of a learning journey, it doesnâ€™t aim to cover every feature exposed by the official application APIs, hence may not be perfect and production-ready. Instead, it focuses on exploring the core concepts, and experimenting with different ideas.

If youâ€™re here to learn, tinker, or just explore alongside me â€” welcome aboard ðŸš€
